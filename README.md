# Full-Stack Web Development Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Full-Stack Web Development Practice Repository**! This repository showcases the projects I've worked on while mastering full-stack web development. I completed hands-on exercises and built real-world applications using a variety of tools and technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, Web3, and more.  

## About the Practice  
- **Hands-On Projects**: Each project represents a real-world web development task I worked on to deepen my understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies.  
- **Full-Stack Development**: I explored the entire web development stack, from designing websites with HTML and CSS to building APIs with Node.js and creating interactive user interfaces with React.  
- **Modern Web Tools**: This practice covers modern technologies and frameworks used in the industry today, including database management with PostgreSQL and Web3 development for decentralized apps (DApps).  

## Key Areas of Focus  
- **Front-End Development**: HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox, Grid, Bootstrap, JavaScript (ES6), DOM Manipulation, React.js, and jQuery.  
- **Back-End Development**: Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, and databases (SQL, PostgreSQL).  
- **Web Design & Deployment**: Responsive design, Git/GitHub, version control, and deploying projects using GitHub Pages.  
- **Web3 & Blockchain**: Learning decentralized application (DApp) development and blockchain technology, including token contracts and NFT creation.  

## Purpose  
This repository is a personal record of my journey to becoming a full-stack developer. It includes the projects I created and the technologies I learned, which helped me build a strong foundation in web development.
